                                    <h3>Vision</h3> </div>
                                <p>To be a global club, active in all high school institutions</p>
                                <div class="titles">
                                    <h3>Background</h3> </div>
                                <p>This idea was born after the realization that the world through globalization has become more connected, and interactions between people, between states and between cooperates has increased. More challenges have also emerged due competition brought about by this trend. This initiative aims to equip students early enough with information on international relations, and how to identify changes in the system and adapt to them. We are also focused to improve awareness on current affairs, an allinclusive scope in political, social and economic sectors.</p>
                            </div>
                        </div>
                        <p>Over time, the world systems and theories have predicted the integration of political entries into a collaborative and cooperation mode of engagement. This has been witnessed for instance by the merger of the BRICS to attempt to bridge the divide and strengthen their position in the International system. The East Africa Community has in recent past intensified their resolve to work together and is ambitious to form a political federation in coming years. Conferences within the United Nations System are beginning to be more and more inclusive of both state and nonstate actors so as to encourage holistic and inclusive societies.</p>
                        <p>These and many other scenarios reflect the need for human beings to realize how dependent they are to one another. Ignorance is no defense and as such this project seeks to improve the alertness that currently exists to International Affairs. The world is becoming a more intimate village and consequently the need to know and understand global affairs and how they affect the man on the street becomes cardinal. Centre for International and Security Affairs’ capacity to carry out this project is driven by the quest to share and spread knowledge to the students so as bring up a young generation that is better placed to create global and local sustainable and peaceful social, economic and political solutions. Focus at the high school level is critical since this is the stage where young adults know themselves and their potentials better. The stage for careers and understanding of what International Relations means is scarce if not available at all. This is the vision of this initiative. The Table shows the ever increasing number of secondary schools students in the country.</p>
